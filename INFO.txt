Easy way to create your own radio menus for ALL, BLUE and RED COALITION.
You don't need anything extra to load into the Mission Editor.
Tested to work in LibreOffice and MS Office.
First you enter "1" for BLUE Coalition or "2" for RED Coalition or nothing for everything else. In the areas with yellow color you allow, you put the elements of the menu, sub-menus and commands. Then creates a script code, which you copy/paste into a DO SCRIPT in the DCS mission editor.
That's it.
