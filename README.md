RADIO MENU CREATOR v.1.2

Easy way to create your own radio menus for everyone, blue and red.
You don't need anything extra to load into the Mission Editor.
Tested to work in LibreOffice and MS Office.

In the area you allow, you put the elements of the menu, sub-menus and commands. Then creates a script code, which you copy/paste into a DO SCRIPT in the mission editor. That's it.

Happy mission editing! :)
